                    Ecology is a field that seems increasingly to sit at the center of things, pressed to make predictions on the coupled fates of natural and human systems. 
                    The majority of land and marine environments on this planet have been severely altered by human activity <a href="https://ipbes.net/global-assessment-report-biodiversity-ecosystem-services">(UN IPBES, 2019)</a>; 
                    a significant percentage of species on this planet are at risk of extinction. 
                    This has often been described as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction">sixth great extinction</a>, and the scope and pace of change makes predictive work incredibly difficult. 
                    What we do know is that these pressures have already translated to instability across the globe, <a href="http://www.fao.org/climate-change/en/">fueling agricultural crises</a>, <a href="https://time.com/5324712/climate-change-nigeria/">violence over land</a>, and <a href="https://ipbes.net/news/Media-Release-Global-Assessment#2-Indigenous">threats to traditional livelihoods</a>. 
                    There is no one solution to predicting the results of such systematic pressures, but one category of solution lies in highly integrative, collaborative efforts that bring together heterogeneous datasets and varied investigator expertise to disentangle drivers of causation in a data-driven framework.

                    I come from a background of journalism and scientific writing and editing, and have been immersed in the culture and priorities of ecological research for some time.
                    Part of that immersion has been in realizing the remarkable capacity for academia to serve as a platform of change. 
                    In contrast to stereotypes of ivory towers, I have been inspired by countless faculty who couple deep, theoretically interesting research with a remarkable commitment to service and community engagement. 
                    Recently, I began laying the groundwork for a shift: a heavy dose of computing coursework at Texas A&M University, in anticipation of entry to graduate programs in ecology and evolutionary biology in Fall 2020. 
                    To give a glimpse of the path that brought me to this inflection point, I embed my professional resume below.
